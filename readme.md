Welcome to the Snake Game! This classic arcade game will test your reflexes and strategic thinking as you navigate the snake through a grid, eating apples and growing longer with each bite.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement: up, down, left, and right.
2. The snake will continuously move in the direction you choose until you change it or collide with a wall or your own body.
3. Your goal is to eat as many apples as possible without crashing into any obstacles.
4. Each time you eat an apple, the snake will grow longer, making it more challenging to navigate.
5. The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or itself.
